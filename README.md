# landing-page

Static landing page using the `free-lite` template. The site is published via GitHub Pages using the workflow in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

## Deployment
- The workflow deploys `free-lite/index.html` and its assets to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
- Push to the `main` branch (or run the workflow manually) to trigger a deployment.
- Ensure the repository's Pages source is set to **GitHub Actions** in the Pages settings so the workflow output is published.

## Local preview
Open `free-lite/index.html` in a browser to view the page locally.
